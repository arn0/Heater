Evaluation first itteration:
- PETG mount does not hold at MAX_TEMP af 105 deg Celcius > reduced MAX_TEMP to 90 deg Celsius, rework ssr placement
- Unmounting cover strains temp sensors wiring > plan rewiring
- Hot glue melted at MAX_TEMP 105 > evaluate at MAX_TEMP 90, lookup specs
- Servicabilty very bad > redesing, add connectors, make modules replacable

Updates:
- Reroute temp sensors wiring for easier maintenance
- Repace pvc wiring with silicone for safety
- Mount SSR directly on casing with bolts and epoxy
- Redesign front casing
- Add LCD
- Move level convertor to front casing for lower temperature and protection from AC noise
- Redesing mounting for power supply and pzem module

Tools:
- Hot air soldering station

Materials:
- Silicone wire 1.5 mm2
- Silicone flat cable 6 wire
- LCD
